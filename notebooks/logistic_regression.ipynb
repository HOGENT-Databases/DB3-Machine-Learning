    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "**Logistic regression** is (another) classification technique in which essentially a (linear or nonlinear) decision boundary is determined. Suppose we have two attributes _Income_ and _Age_ and want to predict whether or not a customer will respond to an advertisement. This is a binary classification problem with two input variables. Logistic Regression will determine a decision boundary as in the figure below (Lemahieu, Vanden Broucke, & Baesens, 2018). (Income, Age) combinations below the line are then estimated as N (does not respond) and vice versa.  \n",
